Step-by-Step Guide to Complete Your Assignment
📌 Phase 1: Understanding the Requirements
Read the Coursework Specification carefully.
Download your dataset (already done: CW_Dataset_4135701.csv).
Check assigned ML models (You must use: ANN, RF, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression).
Note the train/test split and k-fold value (You have: 85/15 split and k=10 for cross-validation).
📌 Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & EDA (15%)
🛠 Tasks:
✅ Load the dataset and inspect it (df.info(), df.describe()).
✅ Check for missing values & handle them (df.isnull().sum()).
✅ Detect and treat outliers (Boxplot, IQR method, Z-score).
✅ Encode categorical variables (if any).
✅ Normalize/Standardize data (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).
✅ EDA: Visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships using:

Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots.
Correlation heatmap.
Pairplots (for feature relationships).
📌 Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing & ANOVA (15%)
🛠 Tasks:
✅ Formulate hypotheses (e.g., "Injection pressure affects quality class").
✅ Perform ANOVA to validate relationships between features & quality class.
✅ Interpret results (Which features significantly impact the product quality?).

📌 Phase 4: Machine Learning Model Development (40%)
🛠 Tasks:
✅ Split dataset (85/15 ratio) for training/testing.
✅ Apply five assigned models:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Random Forest (RF)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression (LR)
✅ Use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
✅ Select performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC).
✅ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimization.
📌 Phase 5: Model Evaluation & Comparison
🛠 Tasks:
✅ Compare model performances (Train/Test scores, Confusion Matrix).
✅ Analyze feature importance (Which process parameters affect quality the most?).
✅ Explain which model is best and why.
✅ Suggest improvements for real-world applications.

📌 Phase 6: Interactive Dashboard (20%)
🎛 Using Power BI
✅ Load your processed dataset into Power BI.
✅ Create input fields for process parameters.
✅ Integrate your ML model predictions (via Python in Power BI).
✅ Visualizations to include:

Predicted vs actual quality classes.
Feature importance ranking.
Confusion matrix.
Production scrap rate analysis.
📌 Phase 7: Report Writing (PDF)
📄 Structure (4,000 - 5,000 words)
✅ Title Page (Student ID, Title).
✅ Abstract (Summary of project, key findings).
✅ Section 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA (15%)
✅ Section 2: Hypothesis Testing & ANOVA (15%)
✅ Section 3: ML Model Development (40%)
✅ Section 4: Dashboard Explanation (20%)
✅ Conclusion & Recommendations
✅ References (IEEE/Harvard style)
✅ AI Statement (Declare AI tools usage).
